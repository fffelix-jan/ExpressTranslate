# Express Chinese Translator
 A desktop Google Translate client for translating between English and Simplified Chinese.  

 I wrote this app because I needed a desktop translation app for a C programming exam (not C#!), and the translations from the translator included with Sogou Pinyin were inferior compared to the ones by Google, and it lacked a speak button. All the other "translation" desktop apps out there were riddled with malware, Microsoft had discontinued their UWP translator app, and Google only has the translator website, which I couldn't use during the exam, so I decided to write my own translator app, which lacks features, but at least it worked well enough for the exam. Perhaps, next time, I should spend more time studying C for the exam rather than wasting my time making my own translation client!
