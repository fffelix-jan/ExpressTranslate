# Express Chinese Translator
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fffelix-jan/ExpressTranslate/main/logo.png" height=200px>  

 A desktop Google Translate client for translating between English and Simplified Chinese.  

 I wrote this app because I needed a desktop translation app for a C programming exam (not C#!), and the translations from the translator included with Sogou Pinyin were inferior compared to the ones by Google, and it lacked a speak button. All the other "translation" desktop apps out there were riddled with malware, Microsoft had discontinued their UWP translator app, and Google only has the translator website, which I couldn't use during the exam, so I decided to write my own translator app, which lacks features, but at least it worked well enough for the exam. Perhaps, next time, I should spend more time studying C for the exam rather than wasting my time making my own translation client in C# with WinForms!
 
 Edit: Google Translate's Chinese version is now discontinued, so I will need to update this soon using a different company's API (but no company can beat Google Translate at accuracy unfortunately ☹️).
